TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out4_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

There is a large setup violation of -3.248 ns between dac_channel1/square/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/has_mux_b.B/no_softecc_sel_reg.ce_pri.sel_pipe_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_out4_clk_wiz_0_1) and dac_channel1/square/U0/inst_blk_mem_gen/gnbram.gnativebmg.native_blk_mem_gen/valid.cstr/ramloop[7].ram.r/prim_init.ram/DEVICE_7SERIES.NO_BMM_INFO.TRUE_DP.SIMPLE_PRIM36.ram/REGCEB (clocked by clk_out4_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
