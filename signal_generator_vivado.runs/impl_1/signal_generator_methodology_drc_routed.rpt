Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clock_manager/inst/clk_12mhz is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_6mhz5540_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_6mhz5540_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks
